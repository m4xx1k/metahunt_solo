# reverse-ats — candidate→vacancy fit engine + gap analysis

**Status:** MVP working end-to-end — §1-6 shipped, tested & verified (IDF view,
matcher+endpoints, CV ingestion, matches-by-id, presentable `/reverse-ats` page).
Ranking-quality pass landed (smoothed IDF + Fit-first sort + real filters — see
*Quality pass* below). Next: feedback loop + market-gap (How-we-fast-track below)
**Branch:** `feat/reverse-ats`
**Sits atop:** ADR-0006 (skills are a ranking signal, not a filter), taxonomy-navigation, semantic-dedup
**Date:** 2026-06-03 (rev 2026-06-06: scoring runs in SQL over a `node_stats`
materialized view · rev 2026-06-07: ranking-quality pass — *Quality pass* §)

## Problem

A candidate uploads a CV → we want to show the best-fitting vacancies and, per
job, *what's missing*. This is **reverse-ATS**: an ATS ranks candidates for one
requisition; we rank vacancies for one candidate. It cannot be a boolean filter
(AND drops a 7/8 match for one gap; OR floods with no order) — it is a **ranking
+ explanation** problem. ADR-0006 already settled the principle; this tracker is
the concrete v1 engine, the MVP build, and the path to users.

## How real ATS engines work (what we copy / reject)

Every match engine is the same 5 steps: `parse → normalize to a shared
vocabulary → field-by-field compare → weighted aggregate → rank`. All the
intelligence lives in two places: the **shared vocabulary** (so synonyms
collapse) and the **weights**.

- **Gen-1 (Taleo/Workday/iCIMS):** resume parser → fields; match = weighted
  keyword presence; `required` > `preferred`; title + years weigh heavily;
  knockout questions = hard gates. Failure mode: rejects qualified people over a
  missing keyword (the "ATS black hole").
- **Gen-2 (Eightfold/LinkedIn/HiredScore):** + a **skill ontology** (normalize
  `React.js→React`, know `React ⊂ Frontend`), inferred skills, embeddings, and a
  model trained on hire/interview outcomes.

We **copy**: asymmetric coverage (extra CV skills are neutral); `required` ≠
`preferred`; weight by skill rarity. We **reject**: hard knockouts — we never
"reject" a candidate, we rank + show the gap. Our **edge**: the ontology (`nodes`
+ `tracks`) already exists and is *shared with dedup* — Gen-2's hardest piece is
half-built.

## Engine v1 (locked)

Asymmetric, skills-centric, single pass over the overlap set.

```
candidate = set of skill node_ids   (presence-only; + role, seniority as context)
overlap   = candidateSkills ∩ skills(vacancy)        // EXACT node_id match only

Fit       = |have ∩ required| / |required|           // 0..1 → tier badge
Relevance = Σ weight(s)  for s ∈ overlap              // sort key
weight(s) = log(N / df(s))                            // IDF, ISOLATED behind a fn
```

- **Fit** answers "am I qualified?" → tier **Strong / Good / Stretch** (never a
  fake %). `|required| = 0` → neutral (treat as Good).
- **Relevance** answers "does it use my strengths?" → the **sort order**.
- **IDF weighting** makes generic noise (git/english/scrum) self-cancel — no
  `is_generic` blacklist needed (full intuition in *Why IDF* below). `N` = total
  vacancies, `df(s)` = vacancies carrying skill `s`. Materialized as the
  `node_stats` view so the score is a plain join+sum in SQL (build plan §1-2).
- **Output per card (two axes + diff):** Fit-tier badge · sorted by Relevance ·
  **skill-diff**: ✅ have · ❌ missing (sorted by IDF desc — most valuable gap
  first) · ➕ bonus (your skills they don't even ask for).
- **Gap (per-job)** = `required \ have`, IDF-sorted = "learn this first to close
  *this* job".
- **Role / seniority / english:** soft, **context flags only** in the gap block
  ("needs Senior, you're Middle"); they do NOT enter the score or sort in v1.
  Promote to tie-breakers later only if ranking comes out flat.

### Why IDF — the weight, intuitively

The one non-obvious piece, spelled out from zero. `weight(s)` answers *how strong
a signal is this match?* — because matches aren't equal. A match on `Python` (half
the market wants it) proves almost nothing; a match on `Ariadne` (niche GraphQL
lib, 2 vacancies in the whole corpus) is a bull's-eye. So we need a number that's
**big for rare skills, ~0 for mass-market ones**. Two steps build it:

1. **Rarity = `N / df`** — "one in how many vacancies." `Python` → 6376/2101 ≈ 3
   (every third job). `Ariadne` → 6376/2 ≈ 3188 (one in three thousand). Raw N/df
   already separates mass from rare.
2. **Why the `log`** — Relevance *sums* weights over the overlap. With raw N/df one
   exotic match (Ariadne = 3188) buries six solid ones (Python+SQL+Docker+AWS+
   Redis+Kafka ≈ 40 combined): the scale blows up ~1000×, so a broad confident
   match loses to one lottery tick. `log` compresses it — the Python→Ariadne gap
   shrinks from 1000× to ~7× (1.1 → 8.1), so six normal matches can out-rank one
   rare hit. Log = "rarity in **orders of magnitude**" (same reason Richter,
   decibels, star magnitudes are log): one order rarer = +1 weight, even steps
   instead of an explosion.

**One-line version:** weight = how rare a skill is, in orders of magnitude. Generic
skills land at ~1 (self-cancel, no blacklist); a skill an order rarer is worth +1.
We sort vacancies by the sum of these over the matched skills.

### The fat tail (`df=1`) — why we never skip it

~2800 skills sit at `df=1` (one vacancy), ~1000 at `df=2` — nearly half the
taxonomy maxes out the weight (`df=1` → `ln(6376/1)` ≈ 8.76). The instinct is to
drop `df=1` as noise. **We don't, on principle:**

- A `df=1` match is two things we can't yet tell apart: garbage (typo / extractor
  hallucination / hyper-specific phrase) **or** the most informative match the
  engine can make (the one candidate with the one niche skill the one job wanted).
  A hard skip kills the best signal to remove the worst — baby with the bathwater.
- A cutoff is a cliff, not a slope: why is `df=1` worth zero but `df=2` worth full
  8.76? No principled answer — that's the brittle `is_generic` blacklist ADR-0006
  deleted, reborn as a threshold. And it doesn't even fix noise: a typo at `df=2`
  still scores 8.07, so you'd keep raising the floor — back to manual tuning.
- The noise mostly self-cancels anyway: a garbage `df=1` node hurts *only* if a CV
  *independently* resolves to that same node — but a typo in one vacancy won't be
  reproduced by a different CV's text (different text → resolves elsewhere). Junk
  `df=1` nodes sit inert in the corpus; the `df=1` nodes that *do* match are
  disproportionately the real-rare ones.
- **If the tail ever does fizz**, bend the curve, don't cut it: `ln(N/(df+k))`
  (e.g. `k=5`) settles `df=1` from 8.76 → ~6.97 and the whole tail eases down with
  no discontinuity. Nothing is ever deleted, everything stays in the diff and
  explainable, tuning is one knob `k` — not a growing exception list. This is the
  whole reason `weight()` lives behind a swappable interface.

### Why these calls (KISS)

- **Per-vacancy, not per-UniqueVacancy:** dedup isn't wired into the feed yet.
  When it is, exclude non-core group members by id — no engine change.
- **Presence-only skills:** accept keyword-stuffing risk in MVP; evidence-gating
  is a clean later add at extraction time.
- **Exact node match only:** the taxonomy already collapses synonyms, so exact
  `node_id` equality *is* semantic match — and stays fully explainable.

## What MVP needs (build plan)

Ordered to **front-load the risk** — does the ranking produce a sensible order?
— before investing in upload UX. Steps 1-2 are testable with a hand-picked node
set, no CV. Each step independently testable.

1. **[DONE — migration `0015`, `libs/database/src/schema/node-stats.ts`]** Live
   on `feat/reverse-ats`: 5,824 rows (every non-HIDDEN skill carried by ≥1
   vacancy), weights `1.11`(Python, df=2113) → `8.77`(df=1 tail = `ln(6433)`),
   generics self-cancel at the floor. Unique index on `node_id` ✓, `REFRESH …
   CONCURRENTLY` verified. **Status-scope decision:** include **NEW + VERIFIED,
   exclude only HIDDEN** — only ~234 of ~5,800 used skills are VERIFIED, so the
   entire IDF-differentiating long tail lives in NEW; a VERIFIED-only cut would
   flatten ranking to mainstream skills (the parked "ranking flatness" risk) and
   is the same kind of cliff the fat-tail section rejects. HIDDEN (2 skills) is
   the one "do not surface" signal, mirrored from the feed. **Refresh-at-end-of-
   ingest: DONE** — `RefreshNodeStatsActivity` runs `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
   CONCURRENTLY node_stats` as the final step of `rssIngestAllWorkflow` (best-
   effort; the per-vacancy loads are ABANDON children, so the view lags ≤1
   ingest cycle — fine for IDF).

   _Original plan:_ A `pgMaterializedView` over
   `vacancy_nodes`: `node_id`, `df = count(distinct vacancy_id)`, `weight =
   ln(N/df)` (`N = (select count(*) from vacancies)`). Naturally skills-only —
   `vacancy_nodes` is the skill join table; role/domain are FK columns on
   `vacancies`. A `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY node_stats` runs as the
   final activity of the ingest workflow (after 02-enrich load). `CONCURRENTLY`
   keeps the feed/matcher readable during refresh and **requires a UNIQUE index
   on `node_id`**. The weight stays swappable — the smoothed `ln(N/(df+k))` is one
   edit to the view definition. Testable with one `SELECT ... ORDER BY weight`:
   generic skills land ~1, niche ones ~8.7.
2. **[DONE — `apps/etl/src/03-discovery/ranking/`]** `RankingService.match` +
   `POST /ranking/match` (and `POST /ranking/resolve` for the skill→node mapping).
   Verified on real data with a live CV (51 résumé skills, 51/51 resolved via
   canonical+alias): top-8 are all Full-Stack/Node roles, ranking driven by rare
   high-weight matches (Passport.js 8.8, Prisma 5.1) while generics (Docker 1.5)
   barely move it; fit tiers + ✅/❌/➕ diff all explainable. 3,785/6,400 vacancies
   overlap ≥1 skill. Notes vs original plan: filters are a minimal inline set
   (seniority/source/workFormat) reusing `ELIGIBLE_VACANCY` rather than feed's
   full `buildWhere` (parked); the in-process correctness oracle is deferred (the
   live eyeball check sufficed). Surfaced the parked **synonym-miss** for real:
   recurring `miss: JavaScript` because the CV lists TypeScript only — candidate
   for `related_nodes` later. _Original plan:_ Pure function `rank(candidateNodeIds,
   filters) → ranked page`. **NOT** the feed's skill filter: `feed.search` treats
   `skillIds` as AND (`HAVING count(distinct node_id) = len`); the matcher is
   OR-overlap *scored* — `JOIN unnest($ids) → vacancy_nodes` (hits the `node_id`
   index) `→ node_stats`, `SUM(weight) = relevance`, `count(*) FILTER
   (is_required) / req_total → fit tier`, `ORDER BY relevance DESC LIMIT/OFFSET`.
   Filters (seniority/source/…) reuse `feed.service`'s `buildWhere`. The
   skill-diff (✅have / ❌missing / ➕bonus) is computed **only for the page's ~20
   rows**, not the whole corpus. Testable with a hand-picked node_id array — no CV
   needed; compare against an in-process reference on the same data (kept as the
   correctness oracle, not the prod path).
3. **[DONE — migration `0016`, `apps/etl/src/03-discovery/cv/`]** `ExtractCandidate`
   BAML (`extract-candidate.baml`, reuses the vacancy `Seniority`/`EnglishLevel`/
   `Skills` types) → `CandidateExtractor`. Stored as `candidates` (contentHash,
   sourceText, extracted JSON, role/seniority/english/exp) + `candidate_nodes`
   (presence-only). **Decision flip vs original plan:** skills are **resolve-only**
   (`RankingService.resolveSkills`), NOT created as `NEW` — an unknown CV skill is
   `df=0` → weight 0 → inert for matching anyway, so creating it only pollutes the
   taxonomy; unmatched skills are kept as strings in `extracted.unmatchedSkills`.
   Verified on the real CV: role=Full Stack Developer, SENIOR, 15/15 matched.
4. **[DONE]** `POST /cv` — `FileInterceptor` accepts a PDF/.txt file (PDF→text via
   `unpdf`, pure-JS) **or** raw `{text}`; `GET /cv/:id` reads back the stored
   extraction. **Idempotency:** `sha256` of normalized text = `content_hash`
   (unique) → re-upload returns the existing candidate, skips the LLM (verified:
   2nd POST and the .txt-file upload both `reused:true`, same id). No S3 (JSON only).
   **Cap fixed:** a dedicated `CandidateSkills` class (required≤30 + optional≤15)
   replaces the vacancy `Skills` for `ExtractCandidate` — the real PDF now yields
   **44 matched** skills (was 15). The LLM extractor is a token seam
   (`CANDIDATE_EXTRACTOR`) so tests stub it.
5. **[DONE]** `GET /cv/:id/matches` — `loader.getMatchInput` reads
   `candidate_nodes` (+ node_stats weight) → `RankingService.rankByRefs`. Query
   parsing mirrors `feed.controller` (seniority/source/workFormat/page).
6. **[DONE]** `/reverse-ats` page — hero + sample-profile picker + real CV upload
   (PDF/TXT) → ranked list. **Cards now reuse the actual feed card**: the matcher
   returns the full `VacancyDto` via the new `FeedService.hydrateByIds`, and
   `PublicVacancyCard` was promoted to tier-2 `components/data/` (2nd consumer).
   `MatchCard` = feed card + overlay (tier badge · relevance · ✅/❌/➕ diff).
   First list is SSR'd from a sample profile.

**Refactor / cleanup done this pass** (resolved the §1-review debt): the matcher
no longer reimplements feed display — `FeedService` gained `selectVacancies`
(shared base query) + `hydrateByIds`; `RankingService.match` now wraps
`rankByRefs` so the skills-path and stored-candidate-path share one ranker.

**Tests:** unit (`fitTier`, `extractText`) + integration (`ranking.int`,
`candidate-loader.int` — stubbed extractor, real db: IDF order, fit tiers,
ELIGIBLE gate, resolve canonical/alias, idempotency, resolve-only, hash
normalization). Full suite green: 214 unit + 12 int.

Critical path: §1 → §2 (the risk) is fully independent of §3; §4-5 wire them
together; §6 is the shell.

## Quality pass (rev 2026-06-07 — first real-data eyeball)

Three pathologies surfaced once the page ran on the full corpus. All three were
*anticipated* below ("signals to watch"); the eyeball promoted them to fixes.

1. **Rare skills over-boost (the `passport.js` problem).** A single `df=1` match
   (niche lib / typo / extractor noise) scored `ln(N)` ≈ 8.8 and catapulted an
   otherwise-weak vacancy to #1 — and these skills are often the ones a candidate
   wouldn't even list. **Fix = the documented smoothing**, no new mechanism:
   `ln(N/df)` → `ln(N/(df+5))` in the `node_stats` view (migration `0017`).
   Settles `df=1` from 8.77 → **6.98** (verified), eases the whole tail down with
   no cliff, generics unmoved at the floor. `K=5` is the single tuning point in
   `node-stats.ts`. (Watch: on a tiny corpus `df+5 > N` makes weights negative —
   irrelevant in prod where `N≈6.4k ≫ df+5`, but the ranking int test had to pad
   its fixture corpus to stay non-degenerate.)
2. **One rare skill out-ranking a broad fit.** Pure `ORDER BY relevance` let a
   lone niche bonus skill beat a job the candidate broadly qualifies for. **Fix =
   promote Fit to the primary sort *bucket*** (the parked tie-breaker, now
   earned): `ORDER BY tier_bucket DESC, relevance DESC` where `tier_bucket` =
   STRONG 2 / GOOD 1 / STRETCH 0 (mirrors `fitTier`, computed in the ranked SQL
   via a `req` CTE for `required_total`). Relevance now only orders *within* a
   tier. Two axes, still no fused fake %.
3. **Same vacancy at #1 and #13.** Not one row twice (`GROUP BY vacancy_id`
   forbids it) — **two duplicate vacancies** (re-post / cross-source) whose
   independent extractions disagreed on skills, so one caught the rare boost and
   the other didn't. This is the parked **per-vacancy-not-per-UniqueVacancy**
   gap; the *proper* fix stays semantic-dedup (score the group's core member /
   skill-union, exclude the rest by id — no engine change). **Still open** — not
   addressed in this pass; smoothing (#1) only softens how far the dup drifts.

**Filters, now real (§2's "minimal inline set" → usable).** `MatchFilters`:
`seniorities: Seniority[]` (OR — middle ∪ senior, was a single `=`),
`workFormat` (REMOTE), `postedWithinDays` (`coalesce(published_at, loaded_at) >
now() - make_interval`, mirrors the feed's freshness coalesce). Both controllers
parse them (`/ranking/match` JSON array · `/cv/:id/matches` CSV query); the
`/reverse-ats` page got a chip filter bar that re-ranks the active candidate
(sample or CV) on toggle. Still ranking signals layered on a *filtered* set —
ADR-0006 intact (filters narrow the corpus, skills still rank within it).

## Refactor pass (rev 2026-06-07 — audit-driven cleanup)

The reverse-ATS work had spread copy-paste; a mini-audit (duplicated utils +
engineering-rule + frontend-reuse) drove four fixes:

1. **Fit-tier thresholds — one source of truth.** `FIT_STRONG_MIN`/`FIT_GOOD_MIN`
   in `ranking.contract.ts`; both `fitTier` (badge) and the SQL tier-bucket
   (sort) read them, so the displayed tier can't drift from the sort order (a
   latent bug introduced by the Quality pass's SQL CASE).
2. **Shared request-parsing home.** `platform/shared/query-parsing.ts` (inputs
   typed `unknown` → serves both GET-query and POST-body) + `platform/shared/
   sql.ts` (`uuidList`). Deleted the per-controller `parseEnum`/`parsePage`/
   `parsePageSize`/`parseId`/`parseDays`/`parseBool` copies across **6
   controllers** (feed, cv, ranking, taxonomy, dedup, monitoring) and the
   stray `admin/monitoring/query-parsing.ts`; centralised the inline `uuidList`
   (was re-rolled in feed.service + ranking.service).
3. **Filter primitives → tier-2.** `pill` / `Section` / `EnumSection` / filter
   `types` promoted from the feed's page-private `market-snapshot/filters/` to
   `components/data/filters/` (the rule-of-three second consumer — reverse-ATS —
   arrived). Feed consumers unchanged (barrel re-exports). The `/reverse-ats`
   filter bar now uses the shared `pillClass` instead of a hand-rolled chip.
4. **Pagination — tier-2 + callback mode + wired into reverse-ATS.** The pager
   moved to `components/data/Pagination.tsx` and gained an `onNavigate(offset)`
   mode for client islands (the feed/investigation link mode stays). The
   `/reverse-ats` page previously fetched only page 1 — it now has page state +
   the shared pager. **Deferred (Path B):** full URL-state unification of the
   ATS page + a feed↔ATS mode toggle (needs UX sign-off).

Verified: etl 212 unit + 12 int green; web tsc + lint clean; `build:web` all
routes compile.

## Hardening pass (rev 2026-06-07 — toward "give it to testers")

Pre-public guards + filter depth so the page survives real users:

- **Abuse guards.** `@nestjs/throttler` global backstop (300/min/IP — high so
  feed SSR, which shares the Vercel IP, never trips it) + a strict `@Throttle`
  on `POST /cv` (5/min per real browser IP, since each new CV = a BAML call) +
  a 5 MB upload cap on the `FileInterceptor`.
- **Filter depth.** `MatchFilters` grew: `workFormats[]` (was a single REMOTE
  toggle), `englishLevels[]` (UI shows CEFR — A2/B1/B2…), `employmentTypes[]`,
  `hasTestAssignment` (false keeps unknowns, mirrors feed), `hasReservation`
  ("бронь"), and `minFitTier` (hide below a coverage tier). The Fit-tier filter
  reads the computed `tier_bucket`, so `rankByRefs` now builds a shared `ranked`
  CTE that both the page and count queries filter on. Enum value-arrays
  (`ENGLISH_LEVEL_VALUES`, `EMPLOYMENT_TYPE_VALUES`, `FIT_TIER_VALUES`) added so
  the boundary validates without redeclaring sets. (Salary deliberately skipped.)
- **node_stats freshness.** Refresh wired into ingest (see build-plan §1).
- **Entry point.** Header CTA "Coming soon🚀" → link to `/reverse-ats` ("під
  моє CV"). The page-private `/reverse-ats` filter bar reuses tier-2 `pillClass`.

Verified: etl tsc + 212 unit + 8 int green, `nest build` ok; web tsc + lint +
`build:web` ok; the refactored ranked query + new filters smoke-tested on real db.

## Presentable pass (rev 2026-06-07 — looks-good-for-users)

The `/reverse-ats` page restructured to the feed's proven shape:

- **Feed-style sidebar.** New page-private `MatchFilters` mirrors `MarketFilters`:
  a sticky left column on lg+ (`lg:grid-cols-[300px_minmax(0,1fr)]`), collapsed
  behind one toggle on <lg. It composes the **same tier-2 primitives the feed
  uses** — `EnumSection` (now with an additive multi-select mode for the
  candidate's OR-filters), `PerksFilter` (promoted to tier-2; "бронь"/"без тесту"
  reused verbatim), and `Section`. The flat top filter bar is gone. Filter model
  (state + enum→label option sets) extracted to `_components/filter-model.ts`.
- **Extraction display.** New `CandidateProfile` (a styled right-rail panel on
  lg+, first thing on mobile) surfaces what the engine understood — role +
  seniority (uploaded CV), matched/vacancy stat counters, resolved skills as
  chips (IDF-sorted), and unmatched strings — so the user sanity-checks before
  trusting the rank. Replaces the old one-line resolved summary.
- **Polish.** Sticky blurred header, slimmer hero, three-column layout (filters ·
  results · CV profile) collapsing to a sensible mobile stack, improved
  empty/error states; responsive via the feed's grid + the Section accordion.

Verified: web tsc + lint clean; `build:web` (feed + ATS routes) green.

## What to look at AFTER MVP (signals to watch, not build)

- ~~**Ranking flatness.**~~ **Partially addressed** (Quality pass #2): Fit-tier is
  now the primary sort bucket. Role/seniority tie-breakers within a tier are still
  available if relevance ties inside a bucket.
- **Keyword-stuffing.** If padded CVs rank fake-high → add evidence-gating
  (skill counts only if it appears in an experience bullet, not just "Skills:").
- **Synonym misses.** If candidate skills legitimately miss related job skills
  (`Postgres` vs `MySQL`) → partial credit via a `related_nodes` graph or node
  embeddings. Keep explainability anchored on explicit nodes.
- **Coverage at scale.** If vacancy count grows large → two-stage retrieve
  (pgvector ANN on a CV embedding) + rerank. Embedding column already exists on
  `vacancies`; add the mirror on `candidates`.
- ~~**IDF quality.**~~ **Addressed** (Quality pass #1): smoothed to `ln(N/(df+5))`
  in migration `0017`; `df=1` tail now 6.98, no cutoff. `K` remains the single
  tuning point — revisit if the tail still over-boosts after dedup lands.
- **Calibration.** No ground truth yet — weights are expert guesses until we
  have a feedback signal (below).

## How we fast-track it to users (after MVP works)

1. **Feedback loop = the unlock.** Add a lightweight "I'd apply / not for me"
   tap on each match. This is the *only* way to prove the engine beats random
   and to calibrate weights. Cheapest high-leverage addition — do it first.
2. **Market gap (the wow feature).** Aggregate per-job gaps across the whole
   feed: *"learn Kafka → +37 vacancies unlock, avg fit +12%"*. Same overlap
   math, inverted and summed. This is the career-coach view users will share.
3. **Profile persistence.** Save the extracted CV as a reusable candidate
   profile → re-rank on every new ingest → notify (reuses tg-notifications) when
   a strong new match appears.
4. **Sort/tier polish.** "Best match" vs "Newest" toggle; growth framing on the
   card ("2 skills from a full match"), never "you don't qualify".

## Decisions (locked v1)

- Candidate-facing, single CV → rank all vacancies.
- Skills-centric score: **Fit (coverage) + Relevance (Σ IDF)**, two axes, no
  single fake %.
- Asymmetric: extra CV skills neutral.
- Exact node match only; presence-only skills; per-vacancy unit.
- Role/seniority/english = context flags, not scored.
- Per-job gap now; market-aggregate gap later.
- Weight fn = `log(N/df)`, isolated in the `node_stats` view (swap to
  `ln(N/(df+k))` = one edit to the view).
- **Scoring runs in SQL** (aggregate over join), not in-process — ranking,
  pagination, and filters all happen in the DB; `ORDER BY relevance LIMIT/OFFSET`.
- IDF weights live in a **`node_stats` materialized view**, refreshed
  `CONCURRENTLY` at the end of ingest (needs a unique index on `node_id`).

## Open (decide on the branch)

- ~~**CV-origin nodes**~~ **RESOLVED:** moot — CV skills are resolve-only (never
  create nodes), so there's nothing to tag. Unmatched skills live as strings on
  the candidate, not in `nodes`.
- ~~**Candidate ↔ user link**~~ **RESOLVED (MVP):** anonymous — no `users` link.
  Revisit with profile-persistence (How-we-fast-track §3).
